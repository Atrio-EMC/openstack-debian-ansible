# iface br-ex inet static
#         address 192.168.1.10
#         netmask 255.255.255.0

# This will bring up a bridge "br-int" for the internal network, and "br-ex" for
# the network connected to the public internet. Here, 192.168.1.10 is then of
# course your public IP address of the router which will deliver network to your
# virtual machines.
